# Security Review Report

This report details the security measures implemented to secure this Django application, focusing on HTTPS enforcement and related best practices.

## 1. HTTPS Enforcement

-   **`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True`**: All HTTP traffic is forcefully redirected to HTTPS at the application level. This is complemented by a 301 redirect at the web server (Nginx) level for maximum coverage.
-   **`SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True`**: Ensures that session cookies, which identify a user's logged-in state, are only ever transmitted over an encrypted HTTPS connection, preventing session hijacking over insecure networks.
-   **`CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True`**: Ensures that the cookie used for CSRF protection is also only transmitted over HTTPS.

## 2. HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

-   **`SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS`**: Set to one year. This instructs browsers that have visited the site once to *only* make future requests over HTTPS, preventing SSL stripping attacks.
-   **`SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS`**: The HSTS policy is extended to all subdomains, ensuring consistent security across the entire domain.
-   **`SECURE_HSTS_PRELOAD`**: This flag allows the domain to be submitted to browser preload lists, ensuring that even the very first visit from a user is forced to be secure.

## 3. Additional Security Headers

-   **`X_FRAME_OPTIONS = 'DENY'`**: Protects against clickjacking attacks by preventing the site from being embedded in an `<iframe>` on other websites.
-   **`SECURE_CONTENT_TYPE_NOSNIFF`**: Prevents the browser from trying to guess the content type of a file, which can be exploited if a user uploads a malicious file disguised as a safe type (e.g., an HTML file disguised as an image).
-   **`SECURE_BROWSER_XSS_FILTER`**: Enables the browser's built-in XSS protection mechanisms, providing a baseline defense against cross-site scripting.

## 4. Potential Areas for Improvement

-   **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: While a basic CSP was implemented in a previous task, a more granular policy could be developed to further restrict sources for scripts, styles, and images, providing an even stronger defense against XSS.
-   **Rate Limiting**: Implementing rate limiting on login and registration forms would help mitigate brute-force password guessing attacks.
-   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: For applications with highly sensitive data, adding 2FA would provide a significant boost to user account security.
